## About Me
I am a MS student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, University of Connecticut. My main interests are plants, both their taxonomy and their ecology in terms of their interactions with insects and mammals. The areas I am most interested in exploring are the tropical cloud and oak forests, as well as the canopy of these forest types.
